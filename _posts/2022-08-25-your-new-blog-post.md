What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
Combining the skills of computer sciences, mathematics, and statistics in order to evaluate trends and analyze data sets.

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
I think data scientists need a strong foundation in statistical knowledge but must also possess computer science knowledge. I think they must combine various fields of knowledge and use different forms of analysis to form predictions about data trends and patterns.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
Differences: Data scientists work with more approachable topics such as data ingest and data storytelling whereas statisticians often deal with more confusing concepts such as p-values and margins of error. Their means of collecting data are often different. Statisticians also use simple, single models while data scientists use complex models which are formulated using machine learning algorithms. 

Similarities: both groups need to have a foundation in statistical studies. Both jobs involve the basic action of data collection and have the overall goal of gaining knowledge from interpreting data. Many aspects of each field overlap, and the fields seem to be converging as time continues. 

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I view myself as a beginner in both of these fields and I am personally still working on discerning between the two and where each field will come into play during my academic and professional careers. I think that the skills associated with both statistics and data science will be useful to me as I go into the field of research. I hope to use aspects of both to make the most of the data I collect.
