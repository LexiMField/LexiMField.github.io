# Project 2 Reflection
My group chose to do our EDA project using the Foods API on spoonacular.
We created several functions for people to use to find different information within the API.
Some of the functions we made include one to get recipes by different cuisine types, one to show wine reccomendations from wines in the API and functions which return food options based on calories.

My main role in the project was creating the plots for the wine analysis and creating the narrative observing trends found in our plots. One of the interesting things I found while doing this is that the higher priced wines did not necessarily also have high average ratings.

I found creating functions with different endpoints to be extremely challenging, so Brant and Richard took over this part of the project. I found creating and analyzing plots to be much more understandable so I mainly focused on this part of our project. I also struggled with learning how to pull, push, and commit changes to the code with github. 

In the future I would make sure I had more practice using github for collboration and I now have a better understadning of how to create functions to be used in an API.
